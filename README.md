# Convergence-laws-of-graph-neural-networks
My thesis for the MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 

The thesis explores how graph neural networks behave on large graphs, and shows that they converge in a certain, probabilistic sense. It contains some novel results, but nothing crazy. It maybe could have been turned into an OK paper, but I ran out of time (joined a startup).
