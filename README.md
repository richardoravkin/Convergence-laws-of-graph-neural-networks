# Convergence-laws-of-graph-neural-networks
My thesis for the MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford, submitted in Trinity 2023. 

The thesis explores how graph neural networks behave on large graphs, and shows that they converge in a certain, probabilistic sense. It contains some novel results e.g for the transormer architecture. It maybe could have been turned into a paper, but I had no time.
